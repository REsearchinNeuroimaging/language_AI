lan_AI: AI based tool for recognising atypical or typical language organisation in resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI) data
=======================================================

"lan_AI" is a tool used to identify language network organization based on resting-state fMRI data. The program takes a preprocessed 4D NIfTI file as input and outputs the predicted probability of atypical language organization. 

This tool should be used only **after** BOLD data are *preprocessed* and normalized to the  *MNI152NLin2009cAsym* template (for example after preprocessing the data using ``fmriprep``)
